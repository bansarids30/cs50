0.  It refers to lung disease caused by silicon dust.
1.  It returns resource usage measure for first argument.
2.  16
3.  It would be more convinient if we pass actual parameters rather than copying values.
4.  We have a for loop with variable c getting a character from a file:
    for 1st if:
    then if the c=alphanumeric or '\''(here we check if index>0) then we add that in word[index] 
    and after increment that index.If index length increases we traverse until end again index=0
    if character is number then we go to end of word using while loop and again index=0 for new word o begin
    else if the word has ended and index>0 then we add last letter to'\0' and check if it is there in dictionary or not and
    if it false then we increment misspelling words by 1. And again we put index=0.

5.  if we use sscanf , then it will store entire string and it will nt be able to check for some other signs
6.  Since the word for check and the dictionary for reference shall be consistant during the spell checking process, 
    it would be safer to declare the arguments as const for those functions
7.  I used trie data structure.
8.  The total time it took was 0.18 second
9.  I tried recursion instead of traversing to each node.Then instead of using each word from file i used each letter.
10. I think it as uninitialized checking in load function and maybe load function can be more efficient.
